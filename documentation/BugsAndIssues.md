## Issue: Mars Insight has stopped transmitting most weather data for now
The Mars Insight weather API worked when I started this work, but stopped transmitting most weather data during this. [Curiosity transmits weather data](https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/weather/) that is currently updating, and an open API exists for it, but I didn't have time to update to that.
