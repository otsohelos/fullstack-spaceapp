# User Instructions

Otso's Space App is a rather straightforward web app which displays various space-related information. It contains four sections:

## Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)
By default, APOD displays today's Astronomy Picture of the Day from NASA. On the bottom, there's a search field that you can use to navigate to any previous APOD or back to today.

## Mars Weather
As the name suggests, Mars Weather displays weather data from Mars, as given by the open API from NASA's InSight lander.
